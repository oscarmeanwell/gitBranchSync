# gitBranchSync
Bash Script to synchronise two branches

This script takes a branch name as an input.

`./mb.sh final-branch`

The purpose of this script is to push your current branch to the specified branch. If you havent pushed changes to your current branch it will do it for you. The specified branch is then pushed and it then switches you back onto master.
